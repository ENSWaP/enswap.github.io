We had to make the difficult decision of postponing the ENSWaP conference.

<p><strong>The new date is: 25-27 October 2024.</strong></p>

The topic and the venue of the conference will not change, we will meet in the Zagreb Waldorf School and explore the topic: Future Skills for a Disrupted World: Sustainability and Regeneration.

We'll publish new information as soon as it is ready and you are  very welcome to join us, please, save this date.
