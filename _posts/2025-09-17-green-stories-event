ENSWaP invites you to a online event dedicated to climate action in schools. Across Europe, 
schools and communities are finding ways to care for the Earth and one another. 
Whether it begins in a school garden, a community forest, a civil society initiative,
or a classroom experiment, every story of environmental care has the power to inspire.
