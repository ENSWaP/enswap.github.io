ENSWaP invites you to a joint challenge for parents, teachers, and policy-makers 
that will take place from 9.00-19.00 on **Thursday 20 February 2025** in Brussels.

### Experience the HERMMES approach in person
This policy-focused conference aims to bring together all stakeholders for quality digital education: European policy-makers, researchers, education professionals, parents, and more.

* How to help a child develop in the digitalised world?
* What is the balance between analogue and digital tools in the lives of children and young people?
* Should the aim of digitalisation of education be that it helps learning or should the digitalisation be an aim in itself?
* How can education support children to grow into media mature adults ready to flourish in the digitalised world?


### Register and ensure your seat for the day
Reserve your spot for this full day conference, an opporunity to learn and share your own experience
with digital education enthusiasts who put childrenâ€™s and young people's well-being at the heart of their work.
