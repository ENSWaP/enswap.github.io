We are starting a monthly meeting where we have a speaker, and we have a chance to discuss issues that concern us.

This school year we will have teachers who share their experiences in what concerns most of our children: online education, the COVID classroom.

Join us, listen to the experts, the teachers who are confronted with this strange reality every day.

We, as ENSWaP, can't meet in person - let's make the best of our digital means and meet online!

The first of our ENSWaP Hours:
