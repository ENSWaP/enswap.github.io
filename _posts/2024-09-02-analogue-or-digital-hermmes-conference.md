After the exciting first conference in Scuola Novalis in Italy, the second HERMMES conference will take place 
in the Netherlands. ENSWaP is inviting you to join on the **21st of September 2024** in our other partner school
Wittering.nl in Rosmalen (NL).

12 partner organisations will bring to you the draft of the HERMMES guidelines and curriculum and 
provide insights into our training opportunities.

We will explore practices that show the relation between analogue and digital paths in media education
while keeping a child’s healthy development intact.
