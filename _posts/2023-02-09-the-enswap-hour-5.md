**Developing an Inner Compass to Navigate in the Digital World**

The world we and our children live in is becoming increasingly dependent on digital media and artificial intelligence. The possibilities seem infinite and with it comes a multifaceted pallet of benefits and risks. As parents and educators, we want our children to be able to navigate this vast and deep ocean with a steady hand on the helm and an inner compass to hold the course. How can we as adults help our children from early on to develop the foundational capacities that are essential to master these new technologies and use them in a creative and meaningful way?

**Speaker**: **Clara Aerts**, who worked several years in Flanders, Belgium, as a Waldorf kindergarten teacher,
a pedagogical advisor and as teacher educator both locally and internationally.
As a member of the IASWECE coordinating group she’s been active in advocacy work in the EU and currently is the project coordinator for the Erasmus+ project HERMMES (Holistic Education, Resilience and Media Maturity in Educational Settings).


Moderated by: **Christopher Clouder**

Time: **1st March 2023, 7 p.m. CET (60 minutes)**
