In this webinar, we will listen to inspirational speakers and find ways together 
to strengthen children and young people in order to build up their media maturity. 
By the time they reach adulthood, they should be enabled to use the full range of 
analogue and digital tools for their own education, for participation in civil 
society and the labour market. Finding manageable and livable solutions at home, 
but also to collaboratively work with their school or kindergarten are paramount 
for building up resilience in children.

The webinar is divided in two sessions. One on <strong>Wednesday 22 May 2024</strong> and the other 
on <strong>Tuesday 28 May 2024</strong>. Both from <strong>19.00 to 20.30 CET</strong>. 
Join us and learn more about the age-appropriate ways to foster digital skills in children.

The European Parents’ Association, the European Network of Steiner Waldorf 
Parents, and the Norwegian Steiner School Parents’ Association contribute with 
the caregivers’ point of view to the HERMMES trainings.

This webinar is organised by the HERMMES partnership but embedded within the 
ALL DIGITAL Weeks campaign so that more parents and teachers can gain access 
to our work.
