Would you like to strengthen the relationship between teachers and parents in your school and in your country?  \
Are you looking for inspiring examples of how trust and cooperation can truly make a difference?

Join us for an engaging webinar on how schools and families can work hand in hand to support children and young people. Through real-life stories, we will explore what effective cooperation looks like - from everyday communication to building long-term trust between home and school. We offer practical insights for teachers, parents, and school leaders alike.

In the event, good practice examples on the country and school levels in Norway and Italy will be explored. We will also look into the "triangle of trust": the vital relationship between the child or young person, parents, and teachers that supports learning and growth.

Whether you are a teacher, school leader, or parent, this webinar offers ideas and inspiration to strengthen your partnership for the benefit of every child.
