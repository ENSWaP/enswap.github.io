<b>Margareta van Raemdonck</b>, on research and good practices around the theme of the conference
Margareta works for the Flemish Steiner Waldorf Federation. She has 20 years of teaching experience. Since 2004 she has been responsible for the work necessary for safeguarding the Steiner curriculum from class 7 onwards within the Flemish educational realm. As a result of the constitutional freedom of education in Belgium, the Steiner school movement in Flanders was able to secure a Flemish Steiner school qualification with university access on the basis of this already more than 20 years ongoing curriculum development. She also works on pedagogical innovations and lobby work in Belgium and in Europe. She is a board member of the European Council for Steiner Waldorf Education. She has started projects on how to collect research into and good practices in Waldorf education in order to share these amongst the federations and schools.
