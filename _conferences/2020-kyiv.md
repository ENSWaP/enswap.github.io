**„The Art of Recognition”** 

<p style="clear:both">
 "I was very surprised and deeply amazed when in 2003 I first came into contact with Eurythmy in working life.
 For the third time living the role of a “student”, but this time in Elena Zucolli’s “Eurythmy School” in Dornach, Switzerland, when I was acquainted with Annemarie Ehrlich’s “Eurythmy in Working Life”, I suddenly saw the “absolute” tool for changing  authoritarian schemes in business structures, economic models and in social interactions that is also suitable for the transformation of personal qualities of staff.
</p>
<p style="clear:both">
 The most striking thing was that I saw a combination of art with the world of practical reality, which is reflected today in the business and social environment: not therapy, but a platform for self-change, transformation of “schemes”, and the birth of new values, a new level of consciousness.
</p>
<p style="clear:both">
I persistently followed this path.
</p>
<p style="clear:both">
 And while going deeper into a new profession, being at the Institute of Eurythmy in Working Life in the Hague in 2005, I was struck by the second time. This time, by the deepest knowledge of Annemarie Ehrlich in the field of the latest technologies of transformational development, both accessible and unique.<br>
</p>
<p style="clear:both">
 I saw philosophy and Anthroposophy in action for the benefit of the most effective spheres of society - working, business and social."
