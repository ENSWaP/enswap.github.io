ENSWaP is a network of parents who take interest in Steiner / Waldorf education. ENSWaP disseminates information and organizes events for its members, for other parents in Europe who are interested in Steiner / Waldorf education and for anyone interested in its activities.

During the course of these activities, ENSWaP gains access to personal information that it processes. This document describes

* how ENSWaP gains such data; 
* how ENSWaP functions as a data controller;
* the different kinds of data ENSWaP processes;
* how long data is handled and what happens to data no longer needed;
* what happens to this data during and after procession;
* the rights of data subjects related to their data.

This document was prepared to fulfill the data protection requirements set up by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter: GDPR). Terms used in this policy have the same meaning that are used in the GDPR. A link to the GDPR is provided at the end of this policy.

### Article 1
How does ENSWaP collect data?

ENSWaP collects data that is generated or submitted when you visit our homepage, when you subscribe or read our newsletter and when you sign up and participate on one of our events. Some of the data we receive is generated automatically by our servers and some are created as responses when you click on links on our webpage (e.g. cookies), download pages or documents. But most data ENSWaP receives is data submitted on the decision of the data subject (e.g. using on-line or paper based forms). We may also receive data from banks or authorities (for example when you execute payment for one of our events or if you apply for a Schengen Visa to visit one of our events in the Schengen Area).

### Article 2
Who is the data controller?

ENSWaP is not a legal entity, nor any kind of civil society. It does not have a permanent board or committee responsible for managing its activities. ENSWaP is a loose federation of like-minded parents who take interest in Steiner / Waldorf education. We do not have employees or permanent staff. We have volunteers who keep our newsletter service running or who organize events. These people are the data controllers. We all work independently. However, we have a similar sense of responsibility and we all agree that anything organized or sent under the framework of ENSWaP is made according to these privacy guidelines. The names and the contact info of these data controllers (the organizers) are made available on our website.

The data controllers for different areas do not share data with other areas (for example if you sign up for an event, your data will not be submitted to those dealing with the newsletters and wonâ€™t be forwarded to organizers of other events). This also means that you have to sign up for events and newsletters separately.

ENSWaP does not have a single permanent data protection officer. We have separate data protection officers for the newsletter and for the events. Their contact information is made available on our website.

### Article 10
This article only enters into force if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an international agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom that specifically regulates the rules on data protection and the minimum requirements on data transfer from the EU to United Kingdom (hereinafter: no-deal Brexit).

In case of a no-deal Brexit the United Kingdom will be treated as a non-EU third country regarding data protection and the transfer of data as long as the European Commission does not adopt an adequacy decision according to Article 45. of the GDPR.

During this process ENSWaP may send the contact information of the writer of the article to the volunteer proof-reading the text. This means that this contact data will be sent outside the EU. By submitting a document to be sent out in a newsletter or to be published on out website you accept this data transfer.
